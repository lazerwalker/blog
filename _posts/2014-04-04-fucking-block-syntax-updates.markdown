I just made a few minor tweaks to everyone's favorite single-page Objective-C reference, [http://fuckingblocksyntax.com](http://goshdarnblocksyntax.com).

* It now has a favicon! This means if you save it as a bookmark (iOS home screen shortcut, etc), it'll look pretty.

* You can now access the site at [http://goshdarnblocksyntax.com](http://goshdarnblocksyntax.com)! Don't worry, the original domain isn't going anywhere, but I've had a lot of people complain (quite appropriately) about the profanity. Now you have the option to access the site behind a work profanity filter or mention it in a conference talk without worrying about offending your audience.

Now go forth and keep writing efficient block-based code!
