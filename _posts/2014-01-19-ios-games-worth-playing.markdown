I love iOS as a gaming platform. The App Store is full of unique, original, and phenomenally well-designed games by independent developers, most of which are either free or embarassingly cheap.

As a result, I get friends all the time asking me what games they should be playing. I'm humbled by how often my friends give me the opportunity to share the things I love with them, but it's frustrating to know I'll inevitably neglect to mention one of my favorites. My first instinct was to write a big ol' blog post with my favorite games that I could point my friends to instead.

The past few weeks, I've been thinking a lot about Frank Chimero's article [Homesteading 2014](http://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/12/homesteading-2014/). If I wrote a blog post with a list of games, it would be but one entry in an endless stream of blog posts, quickly pushed off the front page by newer and shinier things. As I discover new awesome games I want to share with my friends, I'd presumably write new lists as follow-up posts, and soon enough get caught in an endless cycle of churning out content. Friends I pointed to my blog for suggestions would invariably be drawn to the newest games rather than the best games.

Instead, I decided to create a [standalone list](http://lazerwalker.com/ios-games-list) of my favorite iOS games. Every time I discover a new gem of a game, I'll go back and add it to the list. If http://lazerwalker.com is my house, to bastardize Frank's metaphor, this is a shelf on my bookshelf that you can peruse at your own leisure.

So if you're looking for a new game to play on your iPhone or iPad, check out my list of [iOS Games Worth Playing](http://lazerwalker.com/ios-games-list/).
